# Git Project

In the Git project, I had to fork a repository and experiment with Git commands to achieve the required effect.

In the first assignment, I had to move between bracnches, add, commit and finally push repository using git command line interface.
The script can be found in 'git_commands.sh'.

In the second assignment, I had to merge two branches and pick which changes to preserve. Not a difficult challenge, but I thought it was worth mentioning.
The script can be found in 'merge_branches.sh'.

In the third assignment, the lecturer purposefully committed some "sensitive" data, and I was tasked with locating and deleting the problematic commit from the history (everything came before it remained intact).
The script can be found in 'del_vul_commit.sh'.

In the fourth assignment, I had to merge two repositories into one while saving all of the repo's files and structure.
The script can be found in 'merge_repos.sh'.

## Version Control:
-	Git, GitHub.
